SQL Injection Vulnerability: The code uses string concatenation to construct the query, which makes it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This can be mitigated by using parameterized queries or prepared statements.\n\n2. Error Handling: There is no error handling in this function. If an error occurs during the database query, it will be thrown and could potentially crash the application. Adding appropriate try/catch blocks or using a higher-level library that handles errors automatically can help prevent such issues.\n\n3. Performance: The use of `document.innerHTML` to display a welcome message is not optimal for performance. This operation should be avoided in production code as it can block the main thread, causing the user interface to become unresponsive. Consider using an event-driven approach or a library like React that handles updating the DOM efficiently.\n\n4. Security Best Practices: The function directly assigns the result of `db.query` to `result`, which could expose sensitive information if not handled properly. It's crucial to ensure that any user data retrieved from the database is appropriately sanitized and validated before being displayed or used in other parts of the application.\n\n5. Code Quality: The code lacks comments, making it difficult for others to understand its purpose and functionality. Adding descriptive comments can significantly improve readability and maintainability.\n\n6. Recommendation: Instead of directly manipulating the DOM with `document.innerHTML`, consider using a library like React or Vue.js that provides efficient ways to update the UI in response to user actions. This will enhance both performance and code quality.\n\n[EDIT_FILE: auth.js]\nfunction authenticateUser(username, password) {\n  const query = `SELECT * FROM users WHERE username=?
