Here's a possible structure:\n\n**README.md:**\n```markdown\n# User Management API Documentation\n\nThis document provides information about how to interact with our User Management API endpoints. \n\n## Installation\nBefore you begin, make sure that your system has Node.js and npm installed. You can install these via the official website.\n\nTo install our package, use:\n```bash\nnpm install @your/package-name --save\n```\n## Getting Started\nOnce you've installed our package, you will need to set up a connection with your MongoDB database. We recommend using mongoose for this purpose. You can add mongoose to your project by running the command:\n```bash\nnpm install mongoose --save\n```\nThen initialize it in your main application file like so:\n```javascript\nconst mongoose = require('mongoose');\n\nmongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost/your-database', {useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true});\n```\n### User Controller Endpoints:\n\n#### `GET /users`\nGet all users in your database. This endpoint does not require authentication.\n\nReturns an array of user objects, where each object includes the following properties:\n- `_id`: (String) The unique identifier for this user.\n- `username`: (String) The username of this user.\n- `email`: (String) The email address of this user.\n\n#### `GET /users/:userId`\nGet a specific user by their ID. This endpoint does not require authentication, but requires the user's `_id`.\n\nReturns an object with the following properties:\n- `_id`: (String) The unique identifier for this user.\n- `username`: (String) The username of this user.\n- `email`: (String) The email address of this user.\n\n#### `POST /users`\nCreate a new user in your database. This endpoint requires the user's `username`, `email`, and `password`.\n\nRequest body:\n```json\n{\n  \"username\": \"<USERNAME>\",\n  \"email\": \"<EMAIL>\",\n  \"password\": \"<PASSWORD>\"\n}\n```\nResponse body:\n```json\n{\n  \"_id\": \"<ID>\",\n  \"username\": \"<USERNAME>\",\n  \"email\": \"<EMAIL>\"\n}\n```\n#### `PUT /users/:userId`\nUpdate an existing user in your database. This endpoint requires the updated user's `_id`.\n\nRequest body:\n```json\n{\n  \"username\": \"<NEW USERNAME>\",\n  \"email\": \"<NEW EMAIL>\"\n}\n```\nResponse body:\n```json\n{\n  \"_id\": \"<ID>\",\n  \"username\": \"<NEW USERNAME>\",\n  \"email\": \"<NEW EMAIL>\"\n}\n```\n#### `DELETE /users/:userId`\nDelete an existing user in your database. This endpoint requires the ID of the user to delete.\n\nResponse:\n```json\n{\n  \"message\": \"User deleted successfully\"\n}\n```\nThis API documentation should cover everything you need to know about managing users via our endpoints.

Here are some tips on how to structure your README files, API documentation, and user guides for best results:\n\n1. **General Structure**: Make sure you have a clear introduction about what your product/service does and its main features. Include screenshots or GIFs whenever possible to illustrate the use cases. \n\n2. **Installation Instructions**: Include detailed installation instructions. This could be as simple as \"Clone this repository, then run `npm install`\" for Node.js projects or could be much more complex depending on your project's dependencies and environment requirements. \n\n3. **Usage Examples**: It is very important to provide usage examples in the form of code snippets or screenshots. This helps users understand how to use your product/service effectively.\n\n4. **Troubleshooting Section**: If something goes wrong, include a troubleshooting guide. Include common errors and their solutions, along with potential causes. \n\n5. **Formatting**: Use headings (# for H1, ## for H2, etc.) to structure your content, as well as bullet points or numbered lists for subsections. Whenever possible, provide code examples in fenced code blocks (for example, using triple backticks).\n\n6. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment**: If you're using a tool like Travis CI or GitHub Actions, your README file is where they will look for build instructions by default. Make sure to include these in your documentation. \n\nRemember that the aim of these files is not only to inform users but also to guide developers while coding. Hence, ensure every line of code is commented well and any edge cases are clearly explained so that anyone can understand what's going on even if they don't know the language.
