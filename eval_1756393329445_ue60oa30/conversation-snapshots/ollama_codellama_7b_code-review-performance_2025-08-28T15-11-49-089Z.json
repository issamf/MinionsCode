The `calculateUserScore` function is used to calculate the score for each user based on their number of posts.\n\nHowever, there are several performance issues with this implementation:\n\n1. The `calculateUserScore` function is expensive and takes a long time to execute. This can cause the component to freeze or become unresponsive while it calculates the scores.\n2. The function uses a loop that iterates over the user's posts 10,000 times, which is unnecessary and wasteful.\n3. The function does not use any optimization techniques such as memoization or caching to avoid recalculating the same score multiple times.\n\nTo optimize this component for performance, I would suggest the following changes:\n\n1. Use a more efficient algorithm to calculate the score. For example, you could use a simple mathematical formula that does not require iterating over the posts 10,000 times.\n2. Use memoization or caching to avoid recalculating the same score multiple times. This can be done by storing the calculated scores in a map and retrieving them from the map instead of calculating them again every time the component is rendered.\n3. Consider using a lazy-loading approach to only render the users that are currently visible on the screen, rather than rendering all users at once.
