  "currentResponse": " Sure, I will analyze your code and create a comprehensive API documentation for you. Here is how the documentation can look like:\n\n### GET /users\nThis endpoint retrieves all users from the database. The endpoint returns an array of user objects, each containing the following properties:\n- id (the unique identifier of the user)\n- username (the username of the user)\n- email (the email address of the user)\n\n### GET /users/:id\nThis endpoint retrieves a specific user from the database. The `:id` parameter is a required field. If the user exists, it returns a single object containing all properties of the user. Otherwise, it returns an error message with status code 404 (Not Found).\n\n### POST /users\nThis endpoint creates a new user in the database. It requires a JSON body that contains at least the fields: `username`, `email`, and `password`. After creating the user, the API responds with a JSON object containing all properties of the created user plus an HTTP status code 201 (Created).\n\n### PUT /users/:id\nThis endpoint updates a specific user in the database. The `:id` parameter is required and it refers to the ID of the user to be updated. It requires a JSON body containing at least the fields: `username`, `email` and `password`. If the user exists, it returns the updated user object. Otherwise, it responds with an error message and status code 404 (Not Found).\n\n### DELETE /users/:id\nThis endpoint deletes a specific user from the database. The `:id` parameter is required and refers to the ID of the user to be deleted. If the user exists, it responds with a success message: 'User deleted successfully'. Otherwise, it responds with an error message and status code 404 (Not Found).\n\n## Troubleshooting Section\nIn case you encounter any issues while using these endpoints, please refer to the following sections for possible troubleshooting steps:\n- Make sure all required fields are provided.\n- Check if the `:id` parameter is correct and exists in your database. \n- If the password field is not being accepted or needs any sort of encryption, it may be due to a mismatch between the server's hash algorithm and what you're sending.\n- Look for error messages in the response body when a request fails, they often provide valuable information about what went wrong.
