## Analysis Questions
Please provide detailed analysis for the following:

### 1. Overall Performance Assessment
- Which models performed best and why?
- What patterns do you see in the success/failure rates?
- Are there clear performance tiers among the models?

### 2. Technical Analysis
- Which models showed the strongest technical accuracy?
- How did context understanding vary between models?
- Which models produced the most complete responses?

### 3. Failure Analysis
- What were the common failure modes?
- Which models were skipped and why?
- Are there patterns in timeout/availability issues?

### 4. Domain Expertise Evaluation
- Which models demonstrated the best domain knowledge?
- How did code quality scores compare?
- Which models would be best for specific use cases?

### 5. Performance vs. Efficiency
- Which models provided the best balance of accuracy and speed?
- Are there models that are fast but inaccurate, or slow but thorough?
