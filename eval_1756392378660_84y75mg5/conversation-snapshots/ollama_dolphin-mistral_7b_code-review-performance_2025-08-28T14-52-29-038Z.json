The data is being received as props and no external data sources are directly interacted with.\n\n## Performance Optimization:\n### 1. Use memoization to optimize `calculateUserScore` function:\nThe current implementation of `calculateUserScore` performs an expensive calculation for each user, even if their scores have not changed since the last rendering. This can lead to significant performance issues when rendering a large number of users. One solution is to use React's built-in memoization feature by creating a new component that wraps the `UserList` component and only re-renders when necessary:\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { memo } from 'react';\nimport UserList from './UserList';\n\nconst MemoizedUserList = memo(({ users, onUserClick }) => (\n  <div>\n    {users.map(user => (\n      <div key={user.id} onClick={() => onUserClick(user)}>\n        // Same as original UserList component\n      </div>\n    ))}\n  </div>\n));\n\nexport default MemoizedUserList;\n```\n\n### 2. Implement a \"lazy\" loading approach for images:\nThe current implementation of `UserList` includes an image for each user, which can lead to significant performance issues if the list is large or if users have large avatars. Implementing a lazy-loading approach where only the currently visible images are loaded can greatly improve performance:\n\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\nimport { useIntersection } from 'react-use';\nimport UserList from './UserList';\nimport LazyLoad from 'react-lazyload';\n\nconst MemoizedUserList = memo(({ users, onUserClick }) => (\n  <div>\n    {users.map(user => (\n      <LazyLoad key={user.id} onClick={() => onUserClick(user)}>\n        // Same as original UserList component with added LazyLoad\n      </LazyLoad>\n    ))}\n  </div>\n));\n```\n\n## Code Quality Improvements:\n- Consider using a functional programming approach where possible. The current implementation uses an imperative style, which can be less efficient and harder to maintain than a more functional style. Consider refactoring the component to use functional programming concepts like higher-order functions, pure functions, and immutable data structures.\n- Add type declarations for the props and state of the component using TypeScript or Flow. This will improve code readability, catch errors at compile time, and make it easier to work with large codebases.\n- Break down the component into smaller, more manageable parts where possible. The current implementation is relatively small but could be broken down further if it grows in complexity or size. Consider creating separate components for each part of the user list (e.g., UserCard, ImageLazyLoad, etc.) to make the code easier to maintain and reason about.\n- Use a consistent naming convention throughout the component. The current implementation uses both camelCase and snake_case styles, which can make it harder to read and understand. Choose one style and stick with it for consistency.\n\n## Conclusion:\nBy implementing these performance optimizations and code quality improvements, you can greatly improve the efficiency and maintainability of your `UserList` component. Consider these suggestions when updating or creating new React components to ensure that they are performant, secure, and easy to work with.[CREATE_FILE: performanceOptimizationReport.md]\n# Performance Optimization Report for UserList.jsx\n\nThis report covers identified security vulnerabilities, performance optimizations and code quality improvements.\n\n## Security Vulnerabilities:\n- No SQL injection or XSS vulnerabilities found in the provided component.
