# CompanAI VSCode Extension - Project Status

## Current State Summary
This is a VSCode extension for AI-powered development agents. The project has successfully resolved all critical UX issues and implemented core functionality including hot-swappable models and persistent agent memory with learning capabilities.

## Completed Tasks âœ…

### Critical UX Fixes (All Resolved)
1. **Max agents configuration override** - Fixed user settings overriding default limit
2. **Error message display** - Implemented proper webview-compatible error banners
3. **Avatar image loading** - Fixed CSP restrictions and proper webview URI generation
4. **Delete button functionality** - Resolved VSCode webview compatibility issues with window.confirm()
5. **Avatar allocation tracking** - Fixed persisted agents not marking avatars as in-use
6. **Inline styles removal** - Cleaned up problematic CSS in delete button
7. **Event propagation fixes** - Resolved click detection issues
8. **Confirmation dialog system** - Implemented proper webview-compatible confirmation dialogs

### Major Feature Implementations
9. **Hot-swappable model support with context preservation** - Added quick model switcher in agent headers
10. **Agent memory and learning persistence** - Complete memory system with learning analytics

## Current Task In Progress ðŸ”„
**Add specialized agent behaviors based on templates** - Currently working on implementing template-based agent specialization

## Pending Tasks ðŸ“‹

### Duplicate Name Prevention
- Prevent creating agents with duplicate names
- Update default name generation to avoid existing agent names
- Create reserved agent names list (everyone, all)

### Keyboard Shortcuts & Shared Chat System
- Add keyboard shortcut for creating new agents
- Add keyboard shortcut for opening shared chat at cursor
- Include selected text as context when opening shared chat
- Implement @agent autocomplete in shared chat
- Route @agent messages to specific agent's private chat
- Display agent replies in both shared and private chats
- Implement context-based agent selection for non-@ messages
- Handle @everyone messages to all active agents
- Prefix agent replies with agent name in shared chat

### Lower Priority
- Fix panel not refreshing on window reload (attempted but needs user testing)

## Key Technical Context

### Hot-Swappable Model Support
**Location**: `src/webview/components/AgentWidget.tsx:504-616`
- Click model name in agent header to see quick switch options
- Preserves conversation history and shared context when switching models
- No "More options" button (removed as redundant with settings button)
- Connected via `onModelChange` prop in `App.tsx:304`

### Agent Memory & Learning System
**Location**: `src/agents/AgentService.ts:8-399`
- Persists to VSCode globalState as 'agentMemories'
- Learning data structure includes:
  ```typescript
  learningData: {
    commonTopics: { [topic: string]: number };
    preferredApproaches: string[];
    successfulPatterns: string[];
    interactionCount: number;
  }
  ```
- Automatically learns from interactions (topics, patterns, approaches)
- Limits: 50 conversations, 10 patterns, 5 approaches per agent
- Memory cleared when agents are destroyed via `AgentManager.ts:141-144`

### Avatar System
**Key Fix**: `src/extension/AgentManager.ts:264-283`
- Fixed avatar allocation tracking for persisted agents
- Avatars use webview URI generation for proper display
- Avatar service properly releases allocations on agent destruction

### Delete Button Fix
**Root Cause**: VSCode webviews don't support `window.confirm()` dialogs
**Solution**: Custom React confirmation dialog in `AgentWidget.tsx:551-579`

### File Structure Context
```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ agents/AgentService.ts (Memory & Learning)
â”œâ”€â”€ extension/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ AgentManager.ts (Agent lifecycle & persistence)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ WebviewManager.ts (Webview communication & model switching)
â”œâ”€â”€ webview/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ App.tsx (Main UI with model change handling)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ components/AgentWidget.tsx (Hot-swap UI & delete dialogs)
â”œâ”€â”€ services/AvatarService.ts (Avatar allocation & management)
â””â”€â”€ utils/logger.ts (External file logging for debugging)
```

### Important Implementation Notes
1. **External Logging**: Uses `debugLogger` writing to temp directory for VSCode extension debugging
2. **Context Preservation**: AgentService maintains conversation history during model switches
3. **VSCode Webview Limitations**: Custom dialogs required instead of native browser APIs
4. **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup on agent destruction prevents memory leaks
5. **Learning Analytics**: `getAgentLearningInsights()` provides usage analytics

### Build & Test Status
- âœ… Latest build: Successful compilation with no errors
- âœ… TypeScript: All type issues resolved
- âœ… Hot-swap functionality: Implemented and tested
- âœ… Memory persistence: Implemented with backward compatibility
- ðŸŸ¡ Panel refresh: Implementation added but requires user testing

### User Feedback Context
- User confirmed delete functionality works perfectly with new confirmation dialog
- User requested removal of redundant "More options" button (completed)
- All critical UX blocking issues have been resolved
- Hot-swappable model support successfully implemented

## Next Steps
Continue with implementing specialized agent behaviors based on templates, then proceed with duplicate name prevention and the shared chat system with @agent functionality.
